# Tarsier

The latest and greatest in terrible programming languages!
This is the github repo for the OSCON 2019 tutorial [Building a Programming Language For (And Maybe Profit)](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or/public/schedule/detail/76048).

This is designed to be used during the tutorial, but you hopefully should be able to do it yourself using the [cheat-sheet](./docs/cheat-sheet.asciidoc).
